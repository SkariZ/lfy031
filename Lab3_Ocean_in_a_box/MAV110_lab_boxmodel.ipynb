    "## Warming a tank of water in contact with the air\n",
    "--------\n",
    "Let’s consider the case of a tank that is exchanging heat at the surface with the ambient air. Let’s assume that the water in the tank is at the ambient air temperature $T_o=T_{air}=20^oC$ before we turn the heater on, so that the heat flux exchanged with the atmosphere is $Q_{air}(t=0)=0W$. But as soon as we turn the heater on, the temperature in the tank starts to increase leading to a difference of temperature with the ambient air generating a heat flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "We heat water, say at a rate Q [in $W$, i.e. in $J s^{-1}$], this changes the temperature T [$^oC$] of the water. This is the consequence of the conservation principle, heat is not created or destroyed and we need to provide a full account of how much we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we have a flow of something that changes the total content of something: mathematically we have a temperature change driven by a heat flux; \n",
    "that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_p\\frac{dT}{dt}=Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $C_p$ is the heat capacity of water, which measures how much heat is required to warm the water by one degree Celsius. The heat capacity can be obtained as the product of water density times the volume times the specific heat capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_p = \\rho \\times V \\times c_p$\n",
    "\n",
    "where water density is approximately $\\rho = 1000 kg\\,m^{-3}$, the volume of water in the tank that we will consider is fixed at $V=1m^3$, and the specific heat capacity (defined as the heat capacity of one kilogram of water) is approximately $c_p = 4000 J (^oC)^{-1} kg^{-1}$. The specific heat capacity is an intrinsic property of water that is known empirically from laboratory measurements. It is a function of temperature, salinity and pressure but we will here neglect these variations and therefore consider that it is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the heat flux to the atmosphere is proportional to the temperature difference:\n",
    "$Q_{air}(T) = \\lambda (T_{air} - T)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $Q_{air}$ is negative when the water temperature is larger than the ambient air temperature, which is expected as in that case the tank will be losing heat to the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the relaxation coefficient $\\lambda$ is taken constant. For numerical applications, we will use $\\lambda = 3\\,x10^{4} W K^{-1}$\n"
